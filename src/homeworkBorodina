GARBAGE COLLECTOR ANALYSIS
As I can see from GC easy report, memory is not being released, it keeps piling up. The heap size keeps on increasing.
That means that there is memory leak.

COUNTDOWN ISSUE
The root cause of the countdown issue was that recursion didn't work well in countdown case. As in recursion case stack keeps piling up
while the app is counting down numbers. And it causes java.lang.StackOverflowError.

OOM ISSUE
When analyzing where the memory is going, I found out that the amount of reports is increasing and all reports are stored in ArrayList.
Which causes memory loss.
The only solution I could find is not to store reports in array and to store only last one. Endpoint we use gives us only las report so I
decided to store only it.
